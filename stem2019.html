	<h2>all about them</h2>
	<p>We believe in a better place ðŸŒŽ starting with ur face.

Kinship is created by scientists + industry experts. We make clean, cruelty-free products that actually work. For all ppl.

You're perfect just the way you are. But some days you don't feel that way. That's where Kinship comes in. We're ur skinâ€™s support system.

WE BELIEVE THAT...

- Quality, good-for-you ingredients shouldnâ€™t be a luxury. Everyone deserves healthy skin.


- Inner + outer health are undeniably connected. Good glows a long way.


- CLEAN must be the standard. Itâ€™s non-negotiable. We exclude 1,300+ questionable ingredients banned by the EU.



- Woman with closed-eyes tilts her face up to the sky | Kinship </p>
